    description:
      "<p>Peter says “each day I have the good fortune to work with business owners in search of financial freedom–freedom to choose if, when, and how they want to work in and on their business.” He does this by working together with the owner to grow the value of their business-by creating a valuable asset that they can step away from when they want to and on their terms. Peter meets people where they are and comes to understand who they are, where they want to go, how they want to evolve, and what they want to be known for. Thru collaboration, Peter helps owners create the future they desire for not only their professional life but also their personal life as well, so they can enjoy true freedom.</p> <p>On this journey to freedom, Peter serves as an executive, business, team coach, a guide, and a people connector–and sometimes a mentor or consultant. He uses proprietary tools to assess which business drivers, when adjusted will yield the greatest increases in business value, the extent to which the business owner is psychologically ready to step away from their business, and how much business value needs to be created in order for the business owner to reach their own self-defined “freedom point.”</p> <p>As a founder of four successful businesses, he knows what it takes to build value and become free. Today Peter lives with family in Atlanta and continues to enjoy volunteering and opportunities to travel and experience new environments, cultures, and friendships.</p>",
